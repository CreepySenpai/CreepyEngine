'D:\WorkSpace\GameEngineProjects\CreepyEngine_Cherno\Engine\src\CreepyEngine\Scene\SceneSerializer.cpp:243: warning: variableScope (style): The scope of the variable 'camera' can be reduced. Warning: Be careful when fixing this message, especially when there are inner loops. Here is an example where cppcheck will write that the scope for 'i' can be reduced:
void f(int x)
{
    int i = 0;
    if (x) {
        // it's safe to move 'int i = 0;' here
        for (int n = 0; n < 10; ++n) {
            // it is possible but not safe to move 'int i = 0;' here
            do_something(&i);
        }
    }
}
When you see this message it is always safe to reduce the variable scope 1 level.'
